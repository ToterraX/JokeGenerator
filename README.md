This code is part of an application to GeoTab. The following tasks were completed.

### Task 1 - Fix some ugly code ###

I heavily re-worked the laughably bad code. This included but is not limited to:
* Fixing extensive bugs preventing the software from working.
* Refactored the JSON API calls to improve the logic and make more readable.
* Changed some of the text for the questions and moved to resource files.
* Added extensive test cases.

### Task 2 - Write a report ###

Two reports are included below in the project directory.
* Review.doc - Comments to the hypothetical developer who wrote this application.
* Changes.doc - Discussion about what changes I made and why.
